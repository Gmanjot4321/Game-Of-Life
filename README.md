# Game-Of-Life
A C++ implementation of Conway’s Game of Life with customizable board size, probability for alive cells, file I/O support, and detailed game statistics. This project is designed for Windows and uses object-oriented programming principles.

---
This project demonstrates:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Use of classes, private/public members, constructors, and methods.
- **Dynamic Memory Management:** Use of `std::vector` for dynamically sized 2D grids.
- **File I/O:** Reading and writing board states to CSV files.
- **Randomization:** Initializing the board with a probability for alive cells.
- **Game Simulation:** Implementing the rules of Conway's Game of Life with multiple generations.
- **Statistics Tracking:** Recording and reporting individual and overall game statistics.
- **User Interaction:** Command-line menu with input validation.

## Features

- Customizable board size (rows × columns)
- Initialize board randomly with a user-defined probability of alive cells
- Load and save board state from/to CSV files
- Display the board state in console with alive cells (`O`) and dead cells (`.`)
- Simulate multiple generations with optional delay
- Track statistics for individual and overall games
- Play multiple random games to find the board with the most alive cells
- Display the best board achieved across all games
